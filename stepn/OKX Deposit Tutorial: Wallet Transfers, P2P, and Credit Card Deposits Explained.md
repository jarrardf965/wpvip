## OKX Deposit Methods

OKX offers three main ways to deposit funds:

1. **On-Chain Wallet Transfers**
2. **Third-Party Platforms (Credit Card Payments)**
3. **P2P (Peer-to-Peer) Trading**

Each method has its pros and cons. In Taiwan, users often choose wallet transfers or credit card deposits. Wallet transfers are more cost-effective if you already have cryptocurrency in another wallet or exchange. If not, credit card deposits are a fast and convenient option.

## How to Deposit via Wallet Transfer

If you have cryptocurrency stored in another exchange or decentralized wallet, you can transfer it to your OKX account. For example, transferring from **Binance** or **MetaMask** to OKX.

### Step 1: Select Deposit
Navigate to the homepage and click **Assets Management** > **Deposit**.

### Step 2: Choose the Cryptocurrency and Network
1. Select the cryptocurrency you want to deposit.  
2. Choose the correct network for the transfer.  

> **Important:** The cryptocurrency and network you select on OKX must match the ones on the sending wallet. Otherwise, the deposit may fail, resulting in asset loss.

### Step 3: Get the Deposit Address
Choose whether to deposit into your **Funding Account** or **Trading Account** (you can transfer funds between them later). Copy the **Deposit Address** generated based on your selected crypto and network.

If a **Tag/Memo** is displayed below the address, ensure you include it in the sending wallet’s transfer details to avoid issues.

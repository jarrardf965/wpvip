## Creating or Importing an OKX Web3 Wallet on the App

1. **Download the OKX Official App**  
   Visit the [OKX Download Page](https://bit.ly/OKXe) to install the app. Once installed, switch to the **Web3 Wallet** section.

   - Click **[Create Wallet]**, set a secure password, and back up your recovery phrase (seed phrase).  
   - It's essential to store your seed phrase in a secure location, such as a physical notebook, as it cannot be recovered if lost.

3. **Import an Existing Wallet**  
   - If you already have a wallet, select **[Import Wallet]**. Use your seed phrase or private key to import your existing wallet into the OKX Web3 Wallet.

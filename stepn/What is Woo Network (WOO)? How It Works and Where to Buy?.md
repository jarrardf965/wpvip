## How Woo Network (WOO) Works

Woo Network was launched in **2019** by **Kronos Research**, a well-established quantitative trading firm that executes billions in trading volume across multiple major exchanges. Kronos identified a significant issue in the cryptocurrency market: **insufficient liquidity and high costs** on many exchanges. 

To address these challenges, Woo Network was developed, offering an array of blockchain-based products that deliver liquidity at reduced or no cost. Notably, **Binance Labs** participated in Woo Networkâ€™s Series A+ funding round, investing **$12 million** to support the project's growth.

### Key Products of Woo Network

Woo Network offers a suite of centralized and decentralized products tailored for professional and institutional traders. Below are its primary offerings:

1. **Woo Trade**: Provides institutional clients with deeper order book liquidity, comparable to major exchanges, and minimizes bid-ask spreads.
2. **WooFi**: A decentralized platform extending Woo Networkâ€™s liquidity to DeFi users, offering competitive pricing, low fees, and innovative DeFi earning opportunities.
3. **Woo X**: A centralized exchange (CEX) offering **zero-fee trading**, enhanced liquidity, and customizable trading workstations for users.
4. **Woo Ventures**: Focuses on strategic investments and partnerships. Woo token holders receive half of the profits generated by Woo Ventures.

Woo Network integrates liquidity across various DeFi platforms using advanced APIs or GUI interfaces, while also collaborating with aggregators like **1inch** and **Paraswap**.

### Strategic Liquidity Approach

Woo Network and Kronos Research leverage advanced strategies such as hedging and quantitative trading to consolidate liquidity from both centralized and decentralized finance (DeFi) networks. Clients can connect to Woo Network via APIs or graphical interfaces, while DeFi users can access liquidity indirectly through popular platforms like Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and SushiSwap.

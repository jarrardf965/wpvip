## How Does Dustland Runner (DOSE) Work?

Dustland Runner is set in a dystopian future where the year is 2227. The Earth has been scorched by a solar eclipse, leaving behind barren lands and ghost towns surrounded by pirates. In this post-apocalyptic setting, players embark on running missions to collect scarce survival resources, helping rebuild civilization and secure the planet's future.

### Getting Started

To play, download the Dustland Runner app on your Android or iOS device, register using your email, and link a wallet such as [MetaMask](https://coinkickoff.com/zh_hk/what-is-metamask/) to your account. This setup prepares you to start earning rewards as you complete fitness tasks guided by the gameâ€™s story.

Players receive **DOSE tokens** and **NFTs** based on the **distance covered** during fitness tasksâ€”not their performance. Additionally, in-game items and resources collected during missions help players progress further and unlock greater rewards.

### Key Features

- **Run, jog, or walk** at your own pace to complete tasks.  
- Dedicated runners can choose to run **specific distances indoors or outdoors**.

2. **Dustland Runner**: An audio fitness adventure where players earn DOSE tokens or NFTs by running.  
3. **Dustland Rider**: A cycling experience set on Mars, where players ride through unique terrains to earn DOSE tokens and progress further.

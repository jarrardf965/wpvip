## How Does Synthetix Work?

Synthetix leverages decentralized oracles to ensure an efficient and optimized protocol, allowing individuals to trade synthetic assets seamlessly. The entire platform is secured by smart contracts that facilitate the transmission of data.

Through the [Synthetix Exchange](https://synthetix.io/), users gain access to a variety of assets traditionally unavailable to cryptocurrency investors. These include commodities like gold and silver, which are typically traded on conventional platforms.

### Unique Features
Unlike other protocols such as [Paxos](https://paxos.com/), users of Synthetix donâ€™t own the underlying asset but instead trade synthetic tokens that provide exposure to these assets. For instance, holding **sXAU** offers exposure to the price movements of gold without actual ownership of the physical commodity.

Synths, the synthetic tokens, can be traded across Ethereum-based DeFi protocols like [Curve](https://www.curve.com/) and [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/). Users can also earn returns by participating in liquidity provision, generating interest from these synthetic assets.

Additionally, Synthetix offers **options contracts**, enabling users to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a specific future date. This mechanism provides users with more sophisticated trading opportunities.

## Use Cases for Synthetix (SNX)

Synthetix is primarily utilized by users staking **SNX tokens**. Stakers who maintain a collateralization ratio of 600% or higher are eligible for two types of rewards:

1. **Staking Rewards**: Distributed in both SNX tokens and sUSD, generated from exchange fees.  
2. **Liquidity Rewards**: Stakers act as counterparty liquidity providers, simplifying the process of converting Synths without requiring a trading partner.

The platformâ€™s design eliminates the need for order books, enabling **peer-to-peer trading** and enhancing liquidity. Users can trade any synthetic asset type, including fiat-based Synths (e.g., sUSD, sEUR) and commodities.

## How to Buy SNX Tokens

To purchase SNX tokens, users need to deposit **fiat currency** on a cryptocurrency exchange. The SNX tokens will then be credited to the userâ€™s digital wallet.

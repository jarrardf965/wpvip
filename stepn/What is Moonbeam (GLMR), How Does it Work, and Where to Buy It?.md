## How Does Moonbeam (GLMR) Work?

Moonbeam leverages Polkadotâ€™s parachain framework to enhance scalability and ensure robust interoperability. By using delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS), the network processes up to 10,000 transactions per second, far outpacing Ethereumâ€™s current capacity of approximately 15 transactions per second.

Key features of the Moonbeam network include:

- **Ethereum-Compatible Smart Contracts**: Moonbeam enables developers to deploy existing Solidity contracts with minimal changes.
- **Cross-Chain Integrations**: Users can transfer tokens and data seamlessly across different blockchains.
- **Scalability Through Sharding**: The use of parachains ensures Moonbeam avoids the congestion experienced by traditional blockchains.

## What Are the Uses of GLMR Tokens?

Glimmer (GLMR) tokens serve several critical functions within the Moonbeam network, such as:

- **Transaction Fees**: Paying for smart contract execution and network transactions.
- **Governance**: Voting on key network proposals.
- **Staking Rewards**: Token holders can earn additional GLMR by staking their assets on the network.

Moreover, experienced traders often use GLMR tokens for swing trading to capitalize on market volatility.

## What Is OKX Stake-to-Loan?

The **OKX Stake-to-Loan** service is a financial product offered by OKX, enabling users to borrow designated cryptocurrencies by staking their assets. Borrowing limits can reach up to 65% of the total value of the staked collateral. This service supports both single-asset and multi-asset staking modes, allowing you to use multiple cryptocurrencies as collateral for a single loan.

Benefits of Stake-to-Loan:

- Increases the utility of your crypto assets.
- Borrowed tokens can be used for trading or other financial activities.
- Flexible staking and borrowing options.

However, borrowers must pay hourly interest and monitor their **Loan-to-Value (LTV)** ratio closely. High LTV ratios can trigger forced liquidation, so timely collateral top-ups are essential.

### Key Features of OKX Stake-to-Loan:

1. Fast loan approval process.
2. Simple and intuitive user interface.
3. Support for over 100 cryptocurrencies for staking and borrowing.
4. No platform handling fees.
5. Flexible staking models: Single-asset staking and multi-asset staking.

> **Note**: Lending operations involve risks. Use this feature cautiously and manage your positions wisely.

### Step 2: Access the Stake-to-Loan Feature

Open the OKX app, navigate to **Finance > Loan**, and select the Stake-to-Loan option.

---

### Step 3: Choose a Staking Mode

OKX offers two staking modes:

1. **Single-Asset Staking**: Collateralize a single cryptocurrency for each loan. This isolates risk to one asset.
2. **Multi-Asset Staking**: Use multiple cryptocurrencies as collateral for a single loan. This reduces the impact of price fluctuations on your position.

---

### Step 4: Enter Loan and Collateral Details

Input the loan amount and collateralize your desired cryptocurrency. For example, if borrowing 10 USDT, you might need to stake 0.008 ETH, representing 65% of the collateral's current value.

Adjust your collateral to reduce LTV ratios for safer positions. Review the details, agree to OKXâ€™s loan terms, and confirm the transaction. Once completed, the loan details (equity, liquidation price, loan amount, etc.) will be displayed in the "Current Loans" section.

## Loan Interest Rates and LTV Ratios

- **Interest Rates**: OKXâ€™s flexible loans feature floating annual rates ranging from **1% to 365%**, updated hourly.
- **LTV Ratios**: 
  - Initial LTV: 65%
  - Warning LTV: 80%
  - Liquidation LTV: 97%

Monitor your LTV ratio carefully to avoid forced liquidation.

---

## Adjusting Collateral

If your LTV ratio is too high, reduce risk by increasing collateral. Conversely, if you want to free up collateral, you can reduce it, but this increases the risk of liquidation. Always monitor your position carefully.

The OKX Stake-to-Loan feature offers a straightforward and efficient way to maximize the utility of your crypto assets. With flexible staking options, fast loan approvals, and support for over 100 cryptocurrencies, itâ€™s an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced traders.

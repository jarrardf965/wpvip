## How Gnosis (GNO) Works

Gnosis provides a unique suite of decentralized products to its users. These products focus on **creating**, **holding**, and **trading** assets on the Ethereum network. Gnosis products are built on three interoperable layers, ensuring optimal functionality for the protocol:

1. **Core Layer**: Provides the smart contracts underpinning the Gnosis platform.  
2. **Service Layer**: Offers tools for consumer applications, such as messaging bots and stablecoins.  
3. **Application Layer**: Front-end tools primarily targeted at prediction markets.  

Gnosis also utilizes the **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**, allowing seamless interoperability and enhanced capabilities within its ecosystem.

### Gnosis Prediction Markets

The Gnosis prediction market platform, **Apollo Network**, enables users to create markets for various events. Users can actively trade positions in these markets by buying or selling outcome tokens based on their predictions.

- **Outcome Tokens**: Represent the full value of bets for specific outcomes.  
- **Conditional Tokens**: Event-based digital assets tied to specific outcomes.  

GNO tokens are the governance tokens of the Gnosis protocol. Token holders can vote on proposals and network updates within **GnosisDAO**, ensuring decentralized decision-making. Users who lock their GNO tokens receive **OWL tokens** as rewards, which can be used to pay for token listings on the Gnosis network.

## How to Buy Gnosis (GNO)

GNO tokens are widely available on major centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. Before purchasing GNO, users must deposit fiat currency into their exchange account. Once purchased, the GNO tokens are stored in the exchange's digital wallet. For enhanced security, users are advised to transfer tokens to private digital wallets where they control their private keys.

**Note**: Storing tokens in private wallets ensures full control and reduces exposure to centralized exchange risks.

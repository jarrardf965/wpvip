## Highlights from the AMA Discussion

### Addressing Liquidity Challenges in the NFT Market

**Mandy:**  
Liquidity is crucial in the crypto asset market. In DeFi, liquidity mining incentivizes liquidity providers with token rewards, and OKX offers staking services where assets can generate interest. However, in the NFT market, purchasing NFTs locks up capital for long periods, creating a liquidity challenge. With NFT trading volumes down by over 90% since their peak, how can we address this crisis?

**Wang Zijian:**  
As a former NFT investor and now a crypto artist, I believe liquidity challenges require a wealth-creation effect to attract new participants. Current tools for boosting liquidity, such as fractionalization, may not bring substantial results during bear markets. They are more effective during bull markets when the multiplier effect can amplify liquidity.

**Ray:**  
In August, OpenSea's trading volume dropped to $498 million, a decline of over 90% from its peak in 2021. While some solutions exist, the fundamental issue remains insufficient market-wide liquidity. In the short term, peer-to-peer (C2C) NFT lending and AMM mechanisms like Sudoswap could offer more promising directions. Fractionalization also allows investors to hold parts of an NFT and still benefit from its value.

**Christy (OKXNFT):**  
At OKX, our NFT marketplace aggregates liquidity from platforms like OpenSea and MagicEden, offering a unique multi-chain trading experience. Liquidity issues are deeply tied to the non-fungible nature of NFTs. Potential solutions include:
1. **Reducing Non-Fungibility:** For example, grouping NFTs within the same collection to focus on utility rather than unique visuals.
2. **Fractionalization:** While effective, this approach risks diluting the value of the NFTâ€™s completeness. The challenge lies in ensuring easy redemption while retaining holder rights.
3. **Improving Trading Efficiency:** Enabling APIs and attracting market makers can drive liquidity. Platforms like Sudoswap have embraced similar strategies.

**Maomaojie:**  
Breaking through the liquidity barrier requires onboarding more retail users. Community engagement and cultural output are crucial. Collaboration with international clubs and guilds could help expand the reach of NFT projects.

## The Future of NFTs: Opportunities and Trends

### Expanding NFT Functionality

**Christy:**  
NFTs can evolve beyond their current applications. New protocols, such as **ERC-3525**, introduce innovative use cases that expand the functional scope of NFTs. Even if these protocols donâ€™t solve immediate problems, they spark creativity and storytelling, creating hype and adoption.

**Maxi:**  
The **biggest opportunities** lie in:
1. **Trading Platforms:** Improved mechanisms for NFT trading could revolutionize the market as AMMs did for DeFi.
2. **NFTFi (NFT Finance):** Addressing the needs of blue-chip NFT holders could unlock new liquidity sources.
3. **New Protocols and Standards:** Innovative NFT protocols will open doors to new use cases.
4. **Emerging Scenarios:** New ecosystems will emerge as the market matures.

### The Role of Token Incentives

**Mandy:**  
Many emerging NFT platforms are adopting strategies like platform token issuance and trade mining to attract users. These incentives, whether airdrops or mining rewards, are effective in gaining attention during a bear market.

**Christy:**  
In Web3, tokens serve as a blend of currency, loyalty points, and equity. Platforms benefit from issuing tokens, as it boosts operational efficiency and creates a self-sustaining ecosystem. However, token models must be carefully designed to ensure long-term sustainability.

## Advice for Individual Investors

**Maxi:**  
1. **Avoid Secondary Market Speculation:** Be cautious when investing in "hyped" NFTs, especially if youâ€™re late to the news cycle.  
2. **Engage With Communities:** Participate in projects, provide feedback, and leverage opportunities to become an ambassador or early contributor.

**Christy:**  
Develop reliable information sources and objective evaluation criteria. Eliminate emotional biases to make sound investment decisions.

## NFT Market Outlook

**Maomaojie:**  
Iâ€™m optimistic about the marketâ€™s potential to enhance user experiences and provide emotional value. While the bear market presents challenges, it also offers localized hotspots of opportunity. Web3â€™s potential in China is immense, with a higher likelihood of producing unicorn companies compared to traditional industries.

**Ray:**  
The intersection of **NFTs and social networking** will increase community engagement, connecting people through shared interests both online and offline. Additionally, tokenizing non-standard financial assets could significantly raise the ceiling for the NFT market.

**Maxi:**  
While short-term wealth effects may be limited, bear markets offer builders a chance to create robust infrastructure and protocols. These foundations could drive the next wave of innovation in NFTs.

**Christy:**  
Now is the time for builders to act. When the bull market returns, there wonâ€™t be enough time to build. I envision the NFT market becoming more open, user-friendly, and integrated, offering better user experiences and higher engagement.

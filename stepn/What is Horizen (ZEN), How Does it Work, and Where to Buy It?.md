## How Does Horizen (ZEN) Work?

The Horizen blockchain prioritizes privacy. Using zero-knowledge proofs, it ensures that transactions involving its native cryptocurrency remain untraceable. The protocol also guarantees private interactions between individuals, appealing to users who value data privacy and security. This privacy-centric environment enables developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) and allows users to interact privately.

### Secure Nodes and Super Nodes
Horizen boasts over 40,000 nodes, the highest number in any blockchain network. These nodes play various roles to ensure decentralization and maintain the privacy expected by users. Secure nodes optimize communication between nodes and include advanced encryption to prevent snooping. Additionally, super nodes facilitate sidechain hosting.

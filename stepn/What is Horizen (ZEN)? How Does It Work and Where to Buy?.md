## What is Horizen (ZEN)?

Horizen, originally launched as ZenCash in May 2017, is a blockchain protocol prioritizing privacy. Its foundation lies in leveraging zero-knowledge proofs to ensure transactions remain untraceable and interactions between individuals stay private. The network also incorporates a hybrid consensus mechanism to reward participants for their contributions while maintaining decentralization.

### Key Features:
- **Privacy-Preserving Transactions**: All ZEN token transfers are secured by zero-knowledge proofs.
- **Large Node Network**: Over 40,000 active nodes make Horizen one of the most decentralized and secure blockchain ecosystems.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Simplified tools allow developers to build privacy-oriented decentralized applications (dApps).

## How Does Horizen Work?

Horizen's blockchain incorporates security nodes and super nodes, ensuring efficient communication between nodes and safeguarding the network. Hereâ€™s how it functions:

1. **Security Nodes**  
   These nodes enhance encryption, preventing data leaks during communication.

2. **Super Nodes**  
   Responsible for hosting sidechains, super nodes enable scalability by allowing applications to function independently on the network.

3. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**  
   By using zk-SNARKs, Horizen ensures private transactions and interactions while maintaining transparency for verification purposes.

# What is STEPN (GMT), How Does it Work, and Where to Buy It?

**STEPN** is a blockchain-based, move-to-earn initiative that has recently gained global attention. The **STEPN app** has become one of the most downloaded applications in app stores, as it enables individuals to earn while staying active.

GMT is one of the two tokens powering the dual-token economy of this project. The other token is **GST**, a utility token within the ecosystem.

## How Does STEPN (GMT) Work?

STEPN is a blockchain-based project that leverages the "move-to-earn" (M2E) concept. By downloading the STEPN app and fulfilling some prerequisites, individuals can earn tokens by engaging in regular physical activities such as walking or jogging.

- **M2E Activities**: Activities like running or jogging are tracked and rewarded using the M2E model. Many users have already incorporated fitness tracking apps into their routines, making STEPN a seamless addition.
- **Rewards System**: Unlike traditional fitness apps that merely offer motivational badges, M2E applications like STEPN incentivize users with tokens and NFTs for completing workouts. This gamification element, combined with rewards, has made such apps highly addictive.

STEPN's goal is to inspire healthier lifestyles while utilizing blockchain technology to foster social interaction. Built on the **Solana blockchain**, STEPN raised $50,000 during the **Solana IGNITION Hackathon**.

Users purchase NFT sneakers from the in-app marketplace and earn tokens by participating in daily physical activities such as walking, jogging, or running. The app uses two types of tokens:
- **GST (Green Satoshi Token)**: This utility token is used for rewards, sneaker upgrades, and other in-app actions. It has an unlimited supply.
- **GMT (Green Metaverse Token)**: This governance token is capped at 6 billion tokens and was minted during the token generation event.

The app incorporates gaming elements, such as treasure chests and sneaker upgrades, to create a unique combination of fitness, earning, and entertainment.
